# arch-mini-server

This project documents the setup and configuration of a multi-purpose Arch Linux server on a mini-PC. The server serves three main roles:

- **Minecraft Server Host:** Provides a local network gaming server for Minecraft.
- **Internet Gateway/Router:** Functions as a gateway for home devices, managing network traffic and connectivity.
- **Isolated CTF Workstation:** Runs security research and CTF challenges in isolated container environments for safety.

The documentation covers hardware setup, Arch Linux installation, network configuration, containerisation, resource allocation, and security best practices for isolating different roles.

Explore the [`docs/`](docs/) directory for detailed guides on each aspect of the setup.
