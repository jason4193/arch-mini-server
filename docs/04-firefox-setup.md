# Setup for Firefox Browser

- I am planning to use `Firefox Developer Edition` as my web browser.
- The major reason is that is has built-in developer tools and features that would be useful for WebDev or various testing scenarios.
- Having a browser would be essential for installing other tools and packages easily via web and also for general web browsing.

## Installation

1. `pacman -S --needed firefox-developer-edition` to install Firefox Developer Edition.
2. Launch Firefox by clicking on the application using the application launcher on KDE Plasma or by running `firefox-developer-edition` in the terminal.
